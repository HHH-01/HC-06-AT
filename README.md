## Introduction
Task:
1. HC-06 in AT mode to configure it
* Notice that it happened to a lot of people including myself that I can't get to AT Mode. It's mainly due to the wrong baud rate set up when trying to commnunicate with the HC-06.


## Connection
 HC06 -> Arduino Uno
1. VCC ->5V
2. GND ->GND
3. TXD ->Pin#2
4. RXD -> Voltage Divider (1k in series with 2k resistors) to Pin#3
		
## Component
1. HC-06 JY-MCU V1.06
2. Arduino Uno
